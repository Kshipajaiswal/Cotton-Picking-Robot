# Cotton-Picking-Robot
## Introduction
The process of growing and harvesting cotton, a valued natural fiber used in the textile sector, is known as cotton cultivation. Mostly in warm countries like the United States, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan it is grown. India produces cotton on around 12 million hectares, or one-third of the worldwide land used for cotton cultivation. Cotton reaches maturity in 160 days; harvest occurs over the final 60 days. 

Cotton-picking robots have been created to enable quicker and more effective harvesting. These robots can harvest cotton automatically without human input. Compared to traditional methods, they help to alleviate labor shortages and save time, hence speeding and more reliably the procedure. 

Making agriculture better depends much on technology. From seeding to harvesting, technology helps every process whether it is software-based gear or machinery. It enables good quality of the produce, boosts farming efficiency, and lowers skilled labor needs.
